The message should be in the main chat area, looking similar to the other system messages like \"Project backup created successfully.\" It should welcome user, give a short overview of the app, tell them to click Start to begin.\n\nAlso include stuff like:\n- inform user how Context works - it automatically adds the crucial files from your project to LLM context. Keep size down by playing with Context Settings. You can also add your own files to the context - project requirements, etc. (But, what, anything over 150 KB is getting too big?) .\n- \"editing context settings will rebuild  context on the fly.\"\n- This project was created with Claude 3.5 in mind. GPT-4o works ok for simpler tasks, but Claude 3.5 is the first LLM that seems good enough for real software development.\n-- Anthropic Claude 3.5 - smartest, 8192 context length, a lil slower, lower rate limits. Tends to concatenate files, so you made need to ask it for full file contents.\n-- OpenAI gpt-4o - 4096 context limit, a little faster, higher rate limits. Tends to mangle file paths, so you may need to resend some prompts.\n\nPut message itself in its own file.",
