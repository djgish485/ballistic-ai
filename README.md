## Why Ballistic?
- With AI editors you still have the mental overhead of figuring out which files to modify and how the code fits together.
- With artifacts, you are copy & pasting files, unsure of what changes were made.
- In Ballistic your software project is directly tied into the chat. Buttons like Write/Execute/Diff/Undo allow you to work with confidence and ease. The results will blow you away.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/djgish485/ballistic-ai.git

## Tips

- **API Selection**:
  - Claude 3.5 (Recommended): Ideal for complex tasks with 8192 token output.
  - GPT-4o: Faster with higher rate limits, suitable for simpler tasks.
- **Diff button**
  - Diff compares the AI output to existing files.
  - Use it liberally to catch hallucinations and file truncations.
- **Edit buttons** 
  - Not satisfied with the AI response? Hovering over your message shows a pencil icon to edit and provide clarification.
  - To make changes to a the code returned by AI, hover over it to show an edit button on top.
- Click "Tips >" underneath the input area to see helpful prompts for debugging and problem solving.
- For large projects, manage context size by editing context settings to only include relevant paths.  
- Keep chats manageable by clicking "Next Modification" or refreshing the page when you're confident a modification is finished.

## A New Paradigm

- Ballistic was created entirely via prompting. The .modification-prompts directory contains a log of the prompts used to create Ballistic.
