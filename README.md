2. **Enhance**: Add extra context by uploading additional files (e.g., requirements docs).
3. **Interact**: Engage with the AI to analyze, modify, or generate code. Expect and request full file outputs.
4. **Execute**: Use the Execute/Write/Diff/Undo buttons to manage code changes directly from the chat.
5. **Iterate**: Click "Next Feature" or reload the page to manage chat history.

## Tips

- **API Selection**:
  - Claude 3.5 (Recommended): Ideal for complex tasks with 8192 token output.
  - GPT-4o: Faster with higher rate limits, suitable for simpler tasks.
- **Context Validation**: 
  - Review `project-content.txt` to ensure critical files are included in the AI context.
  - For large projects, manage context size by editing context settings to only include relevant paths.  
- **Debugging**: Prompt the AI with: "List a couple hypotheses why [issue] is occurring and add log messages to investigate."
